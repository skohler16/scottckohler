      I plan to use this page as a blog of sorts and to talk about the struggles
      and trials I am going through as a self-taught coder. I will update this
      page the most as things happen.

      Today has been a very productive day. I got started with this webpage.
      Yesterday I statred the 100 days of code challange. I am nervous and
      excited to learn coding and to become proficient at it.

      I was listining to a code newbie podcast yesterday and the guest
      <strong>Scott Hanselman</strong> was talkign about how we only have so
      many keystrokes left in out lives. Just based off of how much you are
      typing, the speed at which you type and the life you have left to live. He
      stated that instead of righting an email to one person you should make a
      blog post or a website. Well i decided to do the latter. I know this wont
      reach many people to begin with but its a starting point. Feel free to
      follow me on this exciting new journey.
